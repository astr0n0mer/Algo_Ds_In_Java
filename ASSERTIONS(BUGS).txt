#ASSERTIONS:-
We can use assertions(using runtime exceptions) in the code for finding out the bugs.
Example:

CODE: -

int a = 1;
if(a == 1){
System.out.println(a);
throw new RuntimeException();
}

Here, if the value of the invariant(variable) changes then we can throw run-time 
exception(i.e the code will stop).
