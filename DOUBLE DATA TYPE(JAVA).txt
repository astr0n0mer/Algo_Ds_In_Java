1.How to print decimal(double) values after some fixed decimal place :

n --> value
.nf --> for representing n digits after the decimal point
.format --> for printing the output

CODE: -

double a = 2.3456;
System.out.format("%.3f",a);
//Output- -> 2.346

2.How to compare two double values:(using epsilon(constant))

CODE: -
double a = (0.3*3) + 0.1;
double b = 1;
if(a == b)
System.out.println("true");

Here, the above code doesn't works, so we use a technique for comparing the values,

CODE: -
double a = (0.3*3) + 0.1;
double b = 1;
if(Math.abs(a-b)<1e-9)
System.out.println("true");

Here, 1e-9 is a very small value which is used to compare the two values,
it is also known as epsillon a.k.a eps(constant), eps = 1e-9

We can increase or decrease the values of epsilon followingly,
1.Refer the two screenshots of the coursera course
2.If unequal values are treated as equal the increase the power of epsillon
10^-8 --> 10^-9 for increased precision
3.If equal values are treated as unequal the decrease the power of epsillon 
10^-8 --> 10^-7 for decreased precision

We can also compare the two double values using epsillon i.e greater than/greater than equal to
or less than/less than equal to, refer the two screenshots of the coursera
